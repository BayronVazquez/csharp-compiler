PARSER FOR C# IN PYTHON 
===================================================================================================

C# Grammar Specification

C# Grammar Specification can be seen here:

Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 	Each grammar rule is defined by a Python function where the docstring to that function contains 
	the	appropriate context-free grammar specification
2.	The statements that make up the function body implement the semantic actions of the rule. 
3.	Each function accepts a single argument p that is a sequence containing the values of each 
	grammar symbol in the corresponding rule.
4.	The first rule defined in the yacc specification determines the starting grammar symbol (in 
	this case, a rule for expression appears first). Whenever the starting rule is reduced by the 
	parser and no more input is available, parsing stops and the final value is returned (this value 
	will be whatever the top-most rule placed in p[0]).
5.	The p_error(p) rule is defined to catch syntax errors.
