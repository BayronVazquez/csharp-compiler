In this assignment, we converted IR to x86 assembly code. Here are the functions and their descriptions:
1) isnumber(num) : checks if the input is a number (positive or negative).
2) setregister(register, content) : puts content in specified register.
3) getReg(variable, instrno) : this is an important function. getReg takes the variable and instruction number as parameters and implements the spilling. It gets the register from the nextuseTable.
4) translate(instruction) : translates the instruction into assembly code.
