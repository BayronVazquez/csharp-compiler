1) Three address code to be designed simultaneously. We can start by sir's 3 address code and add to it. (All)
2) Implementing register spilling and basic blocks - Requires construction of control flow graph and register spilling algorithm discussed in class.
3) 3 address code to assembly - Requires direct translation.
4) set up the data regions to handle global data and constants  - Along with (3)
5) provide some (minimal) library support to allow for writing of useful programs - Along with (2).


In the meeting we'll discuss about the Python data types to use for representing various data structures like symbol table, etc.

#Remove first and last \n's :
f=open('filename', 'r')
inputstr=f.read()
inputstr=inputstr.strip('\n')

#GET INSTR LIST:
for instr in instrlist:
	if 'ifgoto' in instr:
        	labels.append(instr[-1])
		labels.append(str(int(instr[0])+1))



#Make nodes in  control flow graph:
prelabel=1
for l in labels:
	newlist=list(range(prelabel, l))
     	nodes.append(newlist)
     	prelabel=l
nodes=nodes[1:]
